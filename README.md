# What the heck is this?

A helper to make it easy to set yourself up for 'The Sims 4 but Every Room is a Different Pack' challenge started by [Vixella on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YF_BjATDzA)


# How to use

- Clone the repo

- Open up the `packs.txt` file and make sure there are `#` at the start of the each pack/kit name that you **do not own** (this excludes these packs from being chosen).

- Navigate to the main folder in a Terminal app

- Type`npm start`

- Answer the prompted questions (about how many of each room type you would like plus add any extra rooms to the list).

- Profit!
